# Used Car Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project is a part of the machine learning course I took at STC Skills. The primary objective is to develop a regression model to predict the prices of used cars. This model leverages various machine learning and web technologies, including Python, pandas, scikit-learn, pickle, Streamlit, and Netlify.

## Project Description
The project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The dataset used for training and testing the model was sourced from Kaggle. The regression algorithm was selected for this task due to its effectiveness in predicting continuous values. An interactive web application was built using Streamlit to allow users to input car details and get price predictions. The app is deployed on Netlify for easy access.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the model.
- **pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: Machine learning library used for building and training the regression model.
- **pickle**: Used for serializing and saving the trained model.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web application.
- **Netlify**: Platform for deploying the Streamlit web application.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains various features of used cars that are essential for predicting their prices.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/used-car-price-prediction.git
   cd used-car-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit application:**
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Open the Streamlit app:** After running the command above, a local server will start. Open the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your web browser.
2. **Input car details:** Enter the required details such as make, model, year, mileage, etc.
3. **Get price prediction:** The app will display the predicted price for the used car based on the provided details.
